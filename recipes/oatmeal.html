        <p>Learn how to make the perfect bowl of oatmeal!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup water, milk, or non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small saucepan, bring the water or milk and salt to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, stir in the oats and reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the oatmeal simmer for 5 minutes or until it reaches your desired consistency. Make sure to stir occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat, cover with a lid, then let it rest for a few minutes. This will give the oats time to absorb the liquid. If they look too dry, stir in a splash more liquid.</li>
            <li>Top your oatmeal with your favorite ingredients then serve!</li>
        </ol>
